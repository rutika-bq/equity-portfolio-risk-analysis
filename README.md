# Equity Portfolio Risk Analysis

This project analyzes the risk and performance of a diversified equity portfolio using historical market data.  
It demonstrates practical financial analysis, risk modeling, and Python skills relevant to an analyst role.

## Objective
- Evaluate portfolio performance using real market data
- Measure risk through volatility, beta, and maximum drawdown
- Estimate downside risk using Value at Risk (VaR)
- Compare portfolio performance against the S&P 500 benchmark

## Assets Included
- Apple (AAPL)
- Microsoft (MSFT)
- JPMorgan Chase (JPM)
- Goldman Sachs (GS)
- S&P 500 ETF (SPY)

## Key Metrics
- Annualized Volatility
- Beta (Market Sensitivity)
- Value at Risk (95%)
- Sharpe Ratio
- Maximum Drawdown

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- yFinance
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## Methodology
1. Download historical price data from Yahoo Finance
2. Compute daily returns and construct an equally weighted portfolio
3. Calculate risk and performance metrics
4. Compare portfolio returns with the S&P 500 benchmark
5. Visualize performance and drawdowns

## Project Structure
- `Equity_Portfolio_Risk_Analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with full analysis
- `README.md` — Project overview and documentation

## Results Summary
- The portfolio demonstrates controlled volatility due to diversification
- Risk-adjusted returns are competitive relative to the market
- Downside risk remains within acceptable limits at the 95% confidence level

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.10 or higher
2. Open the notebook in VS Code
3. Run all cells from top to bottom

## Future Enhancements
- Portfolio optimization using mean-variance techniques
- Stress testing under extreme market scenarios
- Rolling risk metrics to analyze time-varying volatility

## Target Role
Goldman Sachs – Analyst
